sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt update
sudo apt install network-manager-l2tp

sudo nmcli connection add connection.id [vpnName] con-name [vpnName] type VPN vpn-type l2tp ifname -- connection.autoconnect no ipv4.method auto vpn.data "gateway = [ipv4], ipsec-enabled = yes, ipsec-psk = 0s"$(base64 <<<'[PSK]' | rev | cut -c2- | rev)"=, mru = 1400, mtu = 1400, password-flags = 0, refuse-chap = yes, refuse-mschap = yes, refuse-pap = yes, require-mppe = yes, user = [user]" vpn.secrets password=[user-password]


You have to change:
- [vpnName] = The name of your connection
- [ipv4] = ip of the l2tp/ipsec server
- [PSK] = pre shared key from the l2tp/ipsec server
- [user] = user name to connect to
- [user-password] = password of the user to connect

I don't know if generated PSK will work for you, it works for me. If don't just connect with another PC with GUI, then copy PSK from file /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/{vpn_name} and paste on

Thats it!

To show generated file: nmcli c show id [vpnName]
To start the VPN from cli: nmcli c up [vpnName]
